* README
This is the code repository of the "SuperLearner vs clinicians" study. The bulk
of the code is in [[./R]], but testing can and perhaps should, be performed from
[[playground.r]], located here in the top directory. The main function is
[[./R/make.study.r][make.study.r]], which calls, either directly or indirectly, the functions in
remaining .r files.

** To test and review code
1. Start with [[./playground.r][playground.r]].
2. Run the first lines to source all functions in [[./R]].
3. The remaining content of playground.r is more or less a copy of make.study.r
