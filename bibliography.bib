abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine the proportion of preventable trauma deaths at a large trauma hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, and to identify opportunities for the improvement of trauma care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of experts evaluated pre-hospital, hospital, and postmortem data of consecutive trauma patients who died over a 5-month period in 2006-2007 at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. The panel judged the preventability of each death. For preventable and potentially preventable deaths, deficiencies in care that contributed to their deaths were identified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The panel reviewed 231 trauma deaths. Of these, 84 charts had sufficient information to review preventable factors. The panel determined that 23 {\%} of trauma deaths were definitely preventable, 37 {\%} were potentially preventable, and 40 {\%} were not preventable. One main deficiency in care was identified for each of the 50 definitely preventable and potentially preventable deaths. The most common deficiencies were pre-hospital delays (44 {\%} of the 50 deficiencies), delay in treatment (32 {\%}), and inadequate fluid resuscitation (22 {\%}). Among the 19 definitely preventable deaths, the most common cause of death was hemorrhage (47 {\%}), and the most common deficiencies were inadequate fluid resuscitation (37 {\%} of deficiencies in this group) and pre-hospital delay (37 {\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of trauma fatalities might have been preventable by decreasing pre-hospital delays, adequate resuscitation in hospital, and earlier initiation of care, including definitive surgical management. The study also showed that preventable death panel reviews are a feasible and useful quality improvement method in the study setting.},

This retrospective study aimed to characterize opportunities for performance improvement (OPIs) identified in patients who died from bleeding and were considered by the quality improvement system of a major trauma centre.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: All trauma deaths in 2006-2010 were discussed at the trauma morbidity and mortality meeting. Deaths from haemorrhage were identified and subjected to qualitative and quantitative evaluation. OPIs were identified and remedial action was taken.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the study interval there were 7511 trauma team activations; 423 patients died. Haemorrhage was the second most common cause of death, in 112 patients, and made a substantial contribution to death in a further 15. For 84 of these 127 patients, a total of 150 OPIs were identified. Most arose in the emergency department, but involved personnel from many departments. Problems with decision-making were more common than errors in technical skill. OPIs frequently involved the decision between surgery, radiology and further investigation. Delayed and inappropriate surgery occurred even when investigation and diagnosis were appropriate. The mortality rate among patients presenting in shock fell significantly over the study interval (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}026).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Problems with judgement are more common than those of skill. Death from traumatic haemorrhage is associated with identifiable, remediable failures in care. The implementation of a systematic trauma quality improvement system was associated with a fall in the mortality rate among patients presenting in shock.},

To optimize the prehospital triage system, it is essential to gain insight in the quality of prehospital triage of the entire trauma system.; Objective: To prospectively evaluate the quality of the field triage system to identify severely injured adult trauma patients.; Design, Setting, and Participants: Prehospital and hospital data of all adult trauma patients during 2012 to 2014 transported with the highest priority by emergency medical services professionals to 10 hospitals in Central Netherlands were prospectively collected. Prehospital data collected by the emergency medical services professionals were matched to hospital data collected in the trauma registry.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To better match hospital resources to patients' needs of trauma care, a protocol for facilitating in-hospital triage decisions was implemented at a Swedish level I trauma centre. In the protocol, physiological parameters, anatomical injuries and mechanism of injury were documented, and used to activate full or limited trauma team response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the criteria-directed protocol to determine in-hospital trauma triage in an emergency department. METHODS: Level of triage and triage rates were compared before and after implementation of the protocol. Overtriage and undertriage were assessed with injury severity score higher than 15 as the cutoff for defining major trauma. Medical records for undertriaged patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: In 2011, 78{\%} of 1408 trauma team activations required full trauma response, with an overtriage rate of 74{\%} and an undertriage rate of 7{\%}. In 2013, after protocol implementation, 58{\%} of 1466 trauma team activations required full trauma response. Overtriage was reduced to 52{\%} and undertriage was increased 10{\%}. However, there were no preventable deaths in the undertriaged patients. CONCLUSION: A criteria-directed protocol for use in the emergency department was efficient in reducing overtriage rates without risking undertriaged patients' safety.},

abstract = {Background: The appropriate triage of acutely injured patients within a trauma system is associated with improved rates of mortality and optimal resource utilization. The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) put forward six minimum criteria (ACS-6) for full trauma team activation (TTA). We hypothesized that ACS-COT-verified trauma center compliance with these criteria is associated with low undertriage rates and improved overall mortality.; Methods: Data from a state-wide collaborative quality initiative was used. We used data collected from 2014 through 2016 at 29 ACS verified Level I and II trauma centers. Inclusion criteria are: adult patients (≥16 years) and Injury Severity Score of 5 or less. Quantitative data existed to analyze four of the ACS-6 criteria (emergency department systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg, respiratory compromise/intubation, central gunshot wound, and Glasgow Coma Scale score {\textless} 9). Patients were considered to be undertriaged if they had major trauma (Injury Severity Score {\textgreater} 15) and did not receive a full TTA.; Results: 51,792 patients were included in the study. Compliance with ACS-6 minimum criteria for full TTA varied from 51{\%} to 82{\%}. The presence of any ACS-6 criteria was associated with a high intervention rate and significant risk of mortality (odds ratio, 16.7; 95{\%} confidence interval, 15.2-18.3; p {\textless} 0.001). Of the 1,004 deaths that were not a full activation, 433 (43{\%}) were classified as undertriaged, and 301 (30{\%}) had at least one ACS-6 criterion present. Undertriaged patients with any ACS-6 criteria were more likely to die than those who were not undertriaged (30{\%} vs. 21{\%}, p = 0.001). Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 9 and need for emergent intubation were the ACS-6 criteria most frequently associated with undertriage mortality.; Conclusion: Compliance with ACS-COT minimum criteria for full TTA remains suboptimal and undertriage is associated with increased mortality. These data suggest that the most efficient quality improvement measure around triage should be ensuring compliance with the ACS-6 criteria. This study suggests that practice pattern modification to more strictly adhere to the minimum ACS-COT criteria for full TTA will save lives.; Level Of Evidence: Care management, level III.; },

abstract = {Background: National guidelines recommend that prehospital and emergency department (ED) criteria identify patients who might benefit from trauma center triage and highest-level trauma team activation. However, some patients who are seemingly “stable” in the field and do not meet the standard criteria for trauma activation still die. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify these at-risk patients to potentially improve triage algorithms. Methods: Patients enrolled in the National Trauma Data Bank (2007–2012) were included. All adult blunt trauma patients that were stable in the field and upon arrival to the ED (defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13–15, a heart rate ≤120 beats/min, systolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure ≤200 mm Hg) and did not meet the standard criteria for the highest-level trauma team activation as defined by the American College of Surgeons were included. Demographic, clinical, and injury data including comorbidities, ED vitals, and outcome were collected. Regression models were used to identify independent risk factors for mortality. Results: A total of 1,003,350 patients were stable in both the field and ED. Of these 11,010 (1.1{\%}) died, including 1785 (0.2{\%}) who died within 24 hours of hospital admission. The mortality in patients ≥60 years of age was 2.6{\%}, and in patients ≥60 years of age with either a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or congestive heart failure (CHF) was 5.4{\%}. Age ≥60 years was a significant independent predictor of early mortality (odds ratio [OR] 4.53, p {\textless} 0.001). CHF (OR 1.88, p {\textless} 0.001) and a history of stroke (OR 1.52, p {\textless} 0.001) were also significant independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions: Despite apparent evidence of both prehospital stability and stability upon arrival to the ED, patients ≥60 years of age and with a history of CHF or CVA have a significantly increased risk of early mortality after blunt trauma. These patients are at risk for subsequent clinical deterioration and should be considered for early transfer to a trauma center with highest-level activation.},

abstract = {Introduction: In an optimal trauma system, prehospital trauma triage ensures transport of the right patient to the right hospital. Incorrect triage results in undertriage and overtriage. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate and compare prehospital trauma triage system quality worldwide and determine effectiveness in terms of undertriage and overtriage for trauma patients. Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed, using "trauma", "trauma center," or "trauma system", combined with "triage", "undertriage," or "overtriage", as search terms. All studies describing ground transport and actual destination hospital of patients with and without severe injuries, using prehospital triage, published before November 2017, were eligible for inclusion. To assess the quality of these studies, a critical appraisal tool was developed. Results: A total of 33 articles were included. The percentage of undertriage ranged from 1{\%} to 68{\%}; overtriage from 5{\%} to 99{\%}. Older age and increased geographical distance were associated with undertriage. Mortality was lower for severely injured patients transferred to a higher-level trauma center. The majority of the included studies were of poor methodological quality. The studies of good quality showed poor performance of the triage protocol, but additional value of EMS provider judgment in the identification of severely injured patients. Conclusion: In most of the evaluated trauma systems, a substantial part of the severely injured patients is not transported to the appropriate level trauma center. Future research should come up with new innovative ways to improve the quality of prehospital triage in trauma patients.},

@article{Levin2018,
abstract = {Study objective: Standards for emergency department (ED) triage in the United States rely heavily on subjective assessment and are limited in their ability to risk-stratify patients. This study seeks to evaluate an electronic triage system (e-triage) based on machine learning that predicts likelihood of acute outcomes enabling improved patient differentiation. Methods: A multisite, retrospective, cross-sectional study of 172,726 ED visits from urban and community EDs was conducted. E-triage is composed of a random forest model applied to triage data (vital signs, chief complaint, and active medical history) that predicts the need for critical care, an emergency procedure, and inpatient hospitalization in parallel and translates risk to triage level designations. Predicted outcomes and secondary outcomes of elevated troponin and lactate levels were evaluated and compared with the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). Results: E-triage predictions had an area under the curve ranging from 0.73 to 0.92 and demonstrated equivalent or improved identification of clinical patient outcomes compared with ESI at both EDs. E-triage provided rationale for risk-based differentiation of the more than 65{\%} of ED visits triaged to ESI level 3. Matching the ESI patient distribution for comparisons, e-triage identified more than 10{\%} (14,326 patients) of ESI level 3 patients requiring up triage who had substantially increased risk of critical care or emergency procedure (1.7{\%} ESI level 3 versus 6.2{\%} up triaged) and hospitalization (18.9{\%} versus 45.4{\%}) across EDs. Conclusion: E-triage more accurately classifies ESI level 3 patients and highlights opportunities to use predictive analytics to support triage decisionmaking. Further prospective validation is needed.},

abstract = {Background Overtriage not only wastes resources but also displaces the patient from their community and causes delay of treatment for the more seriously injured. This study aimed to validate the Random Forest computer model (RFM) as means of better triaging trauma patients to level 1 trauma centers. Methods Adult trauma patients with "medium activation" presenting via helicopter to a level 1 trauma center from May 2007 to May 2009 were included. The "medium activation" trauma patient is alert and hemodynamically stable on scene but has either subnormal vital signs or accumulation of risk factors that may indicate a potentially serious injury. Variables included in the RFM analysis were demographics, mechanism of injury, prehospital fluid, medications, vitals, and disposition. Statistical analysis was performed via the Random Forest algorithm to compare our institutional triage rate to rates determined by the RFM. Results A total of 1653 patients were included in this study, of which 496 were used in the testing set of the RFM. In our testing set, 33.8{\%} of patients brought to our level 1 trauma center could have been managed at a level 3 trauma center, and 88{\%} of patients who required a level 1 trauma center were identified correctly. In the testing set, there was an overtriage rate of 66{\%}, whereas using the RFM, we decreased the overtriage rate to 42{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). There was an undertriage rate of 8.3{\%}. The RFM predicted patient disposition with a sensitivity of 89{\%}, specificity of 42{\%}, negative predictive value of 92{\%}, and positive predictive value of 34{\%}. Conclusions Although prospective validation is required, it appears that computer modeling potentially could be used to guide triage decisions, allowing both more accurate triage and more efficient use of the trauma system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Follin2016,
abstract = {Background There is a need for better allocation of medical resources in polytrauma, by optimizing both the over and undertriage rates. The goal of this study is to provide a new working definition for polytrauma based on the prediction of the need for specialized trauma care. Methods This is a prospective, observational study, performed in a specialized trauma center in Paris. All consecutive patients admitted for a trauma at a major trauma center in Paris were included in the study. The primary outcome was the need for specialized trauma care as defined by the North American consensus. The explanatory variables included basic variables collected on scene. The modeling approach relied on recursive partitioning based decision trees. Its prediction performance was evaluated both internally and externally on a validation cohort, and compared to the MGAP (Mechanism, Glasgow coma scale, Age and Arterial pressure) score. Measurements and main results 1160 patients were included in the analysis over a 3-year period (2012-2014), out of which 41{\%} needed specialized trauma care as defined by the recent US guidelines. The decision tree outperformed the MGAP and reached an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 [0.79-0.84]. This optimal decision rule was associated with a sensitivity of 0.94 [0.92-0.96], a specificity of 0.48 [0.44-0.52]. A conservative decision rule (refer to a trauma center all patient with a predicted probability ≥0.34) would result in an undertriage rate of 5.7{\%} and an overtriage of 52.3{\%} (respectively 7{\%} and 64{\%} in the validation cohort). Conclusions Our tree-based decision algorithm is a user-friendly and reliable alternative to the preexisting scores, which offers good performance to predict the need for specialized trauma care.},

@article{Liu2017,
abstract = {To date, there are no reviews on machine learning (ML) for predicting outcomes in trauma. Consequently, it remains unclear as to how ML-based prediction models compare in the triage and assessment of trauma patients. The objective of this review was to survey and identify studies involving ML for predicting outcomes in trauma, with the hypothesis that models predicting similar outcomes may share common features but the performance of ML in these studies will differ greatly. MEDLINE and other databases were searched for studies involving trauma and ML. Sixty-five observational studies involving ML for the prediction of trauma outcomes met inclusion criteria. In total 2,433,180 patients were included in the studies. The studies focused on prediction of the following outcome measures: survival/mortality (n = 34), morbidity/shock/hemorrhage (n = 12), hospital length of stay (n = 7), hospital admission/triage (n = 6), traumatic brain injury (n = 4), life-saving interventions (n = 5), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 4), and transfusion (n = 1). Six studies were prospective observational studies. Of the 65 studies, 33 used artificial neural networks for prediction. Importantly, most studies demonstrated the benefits of ML models. However, algorithm performance was assessed differently by different authors. Sensitivity-specificity gap values varied greatly from 0.035 to 0.927. Notably, studies shared many features for model development. A common ML feature base may be determined for predicting outcomes in trauma. However, the impact of ML will require further validation in prospective observational studies and randomized clinical trials, establishment of common performance criteria, and high-quality evidence about clinical and economic impacts before ML can be widely accepted in practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While there is a need for good quality care for patients with serious reversible disease in all countries in the world, Emergency and Critical Care tends to be one of the weakest parts of health systems in low-income countries. We assessed the structure and availability of resources for Emergency and Critical Care in Tanzania in order to identify the priorities for improving care in this neglected specialty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Ten hospitals in four regions of Tanzania were assessed using a structured data collection tool. Quality was evaluated with standards developed from the literature and expert opinion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Important deficits were identified in infrastructure, routines and training. Only 30{\%} of the hospitals had an emergency room for adult and paediatric patients. None of the seven district and regional hospitals had a triage area or intensive care unit for adults. Only 40{\%} of the hospitals had formal systems for adult triage and in less than one third were critically ill patients seen by clinicians more than once daily. In 80{\%} of the hospitals there were no staff trained in adult triage or critical care. In contrast, a majority of equipment and drugs necessary for emergency and critical care were available in the hospitals (median 90{\%} and 100{\%} respectively. The referral/private hospitals tended to have a greater overall availability of resources (median 89.7{\%}) than district/regional hospitals (median 70.6).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Many of the structures necessary for Emergency and Critical Care are lacking in hospitals in Tanzania. Particular weaknesses are infrastructure, routines and training, whereas the availability of drugs and equipment is generally good. Policies to improve hospital systems for the care of emergency and critically ill patients should be prioritised.},

abstract = {To cite: Kunitake RC, Kornblith LZ, Cohen MJ, et al. Trauma Surg Acute Care Open 2018;3:1–6. AbsTrACT background Prior mortality prediction models have incorporated severity of anatomic injury quantified by Abbreviated Injury Severity Score (AIS). Using a prospective cohort, a new score independent of AIS was developed using clinical and laboratory markers present on emergency department presentation to predict 28-day mortality. Methods All patients (n=1427) enrolled in an ongoing prospective cohort study were included. Demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were recorded on admission. True random number generator technique divided the cohort into derivation (n=707) and validation groups (n=720). Using Youden indices, threshold values were selected for each potential predictor in the derivation cohort. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors. Significant variables were equally weighted to create a new mortality prediction score, the Trauma Early Mortality Prediction Tool (TEMPT) score. Area under the curve (AUC) was tested in the validation group. Pairwise comparison of Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS), Revised Trauma Score, Glasgow Coma Scale, and Injury Severity Score were tested against the TEMPT score. results There was no difference between baseline characteristics between derivation and validation groups. In multiple logistic regression, a model with presence of traumatic brain injury, increased age, elevated systolic blood pressure, decreased base excess, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, increased international normalized ratio (INR), and decreased temperature accurately predicted mortality at 28 days (AUC 0.93, 95{\%} CI 0.90 to 0.96, P{\textless}0.001). In the validation cohort, this score, termed TEMPT, predicted 28-day mortality with an AUC 0.94 (95{\%} CI 0.92 to 0.97). The TEMPT score preformed similarly to the revised TRISS score for severely injured patients and was highly predictive in those having mild to moderate injury. Discussion TEMPT is a simple AIS-independent mortality prediction tool applicable very early following injury. TEMPT provides an AIS-independent score that could be used for early identification of those at risk of doing poorly following even minor injury. Level of evidence Level II.},

@article{DeMunter2017,
abstract = {Background Trauma is the leading cause of death in individuals younger than 40 years. There are many different models for predicting patient outcome following trauma. To our knowledge, no comprehensive review has been performed on prognostic models for the general trauma population. Therefore, this review aimed to describe (1) existing mortality prediction models for the general trauma population, (2) the methodological quality and (3) which variables are most relevant for the model prediction of mortality in the general trauma population. Methods An online search was conducted in June 2015 using Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Cinahl, Cochrane, Google Scholar and PubMed. Relevant English peer-reviewed articles that developed, validated or updated mortality prediction models in a general trauma population were included. Results A total of 90 articles were included. The cohort sizes ranged from 100 to 1,115,389 patients, with overall mortality rates that ranged from 0.6{\%} to 35{\%}. The Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) was the most commonly used model. A total of 258 models were described in the articles, of which only 103 models (40{\%}) were externally validated. Cases with missing values were often excluded and discrimination of the different prediction models ranged widely (AUROC between 0.59 and 0.98). The predictors were often included as dichotomized or categorical variables, while continuous variables showed better performance. Conclusion Researchers are still searching for a better mortality prediction model in the general trauma population. Models should 1) be developed and/or validated using an adequate sample size with sufficient events per predictor variable, 2) use multiple imputation models to address missing values, 3) use the continuous variant of the predictor if available and 4) incorporate all different types of readily available predictors (i.e., physiological variables, anatomical variables, injury cause/mechanism, and demographic variables). Furthermore, while mortality rates are decreasing, it is important to develop models that predict physical, cognitive status, or quality of life to measure quality of care.},
